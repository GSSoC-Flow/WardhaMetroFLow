## About the Project
<a id="about-the-project"></a>

**WardhaMetroFlow** is a proof-of-concept simulation platform that demonstrates how AI can enhance urban mobility in emerging smart cities. Inspired by *India's Smart City Mission*, this project provides a tool for both passengers and administrators to interact with a virtual metro system.

It offers two distinct, interactive views:

- **Passenger View**: A user-facing interface for planning journeys. Passengers can select their start and end points, receive intelligent route suggestions, and see estimated arrival times.  
- **Admin View**: A comprehensive dashboard for transit authorities. Administrators can monitor metro traffic in real-time, manage station data, and analyze predictive models for traffic flow and potential congestion.

## Key Features
<a id="features"></a>


### Frontend
-Static HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Passenger/Admin dashboards)
-Leaflet.js (Map rendering)
- **Interactive Route Planning**: A map-based interface for easy route selection.  
- **Real-time Simulation**: Simulates passenger flow and station activity.  
- **AI-Powered Predictions**: Utilizes machine learning models for route optimization and traffic forecasting.  
- **Dual Dashboards**: Separate, feature-rich interfaces for passengers and administrators.  
- **Voice/Text Input**: Optional voice and text commands for accessibility.  
- **Scalable Architecture**: A modular codebase designed for expansion and easy maintenance.

## System Architecture
<a id="system-architecture"></a>

The components of **WardhaMetroFlow** interact as follows:

1. The **Frontend (React)** communicates with the **Backend (Flask/FastAPI)**.  
2. The **Backend** processes requests, serves API routes, and contains the core application logic.  
3. The **Database (SQLite)** stores all metro, station, and passenger data.  
4. The **ML Model (model.pkl)** is loaded by the backend to provide predictions for route optimization and traffic analysis.  

3. Navigate to frontend and run app:

   ```bash
   You can open the following files directly in your browser:
  -frontend/passenger/passenger.html
  -frontend/admin/admin.html
   ```
##Note: npm install are outdated, since no package.json exists in frontend/.
If you’d like, you can contribute by helping migrate this static frontend to React in the future

## Good First Issues
* Looking for a place to start? Here are some ideas:
* Add a new station to the map data.
* Create a sample JSON file for a new metro route.
* Improve the accuracy of the route prediction model.
* Enhance the styling of the Passenger dashboard.
* Optimize data visualization components on the Admin dashboard.
